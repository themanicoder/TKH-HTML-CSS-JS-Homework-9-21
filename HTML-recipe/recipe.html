            <p>Fried rice is a quick and delicious way to transform leftovers into something greater than the sum of its parts.
                Though we sometimes think of certain ingredients being typical (eggs, garlic) the only things you need to make fried rice are heat, rice, and oil. 
                Anything else you add is up to you. Before you start cooking a batch though, read our tips below first!</p>
